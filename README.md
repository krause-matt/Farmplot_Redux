# Garden Plotter App

Garden Plotter is a social app for documenting a personal garden and sharing with others. Garden Plotter is the first app I created using React + Redux. I chose Redux because there are many garden details which need to have their state tracked across several components.

## Features

### Authentication/Authorization

Access the app and edit only your garden plots using Google OAuth

### All CRUD Operations

Make new gardens, edit as you progress through the growing season, delete saved items or entire gardens

### Garden Documenting

Record plant types, varieties, sow/plant and harvest dates. Style your garden descriptions using background and text color-pickers.
